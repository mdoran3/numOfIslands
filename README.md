Given a 2D grid map of `1`s that represent water and `0`s that represent water, count the number of islands that exist. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume that all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. Islands are `1`s that are connected by horizontals or verticals (not diagonals!). The gride will be a 2D array of chars. 

Examples:
```
Input:

11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

```
Input:

11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```
